<h1>Helper Methods</h1>
<h2><p>ES6 JavaScript</p></h2>

<p>
This repository is shows quick examples of how to use <strong>Helper Methods</strong> to reduce the amount of code written,
which can hopefully decrease the errors possible in code. 
</p>

<br>

#Repo Structure/Instructions

<p>1) download zip file or clone repo</p>
<p>2) Folders are named after the <strong>Helper Methods</strong></p>
<p>3) Inside each folder will be a file (nameOfHelper.js) and <em>toy problem</em> folder. The helper method file will have examples of a traditional way to do things, and then an example of how to use the <strong>Helper Method</strong> in substitution.
The toy problem folder will have a <em>toy problem</em> to test your understanding.
</p>

#Note
* Feel free to code in some examples or add notes to help you better understand <br>
* If you find errors or want to contribute different toy problems,  initiate a pull request and I'll happily review

#Contributing Toy Problems 
* The best use for this repo will be expanding basic understanding of helper methods and adding toy problems that are basic and advanced 
* If you would like to add a toy problem  
  - add a file in the "toyProblems" folder and name it "helperMethod1.js" with the number being an addition iteration.
  
  <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> if the current file structure is forEach > toyProblems > forEach1.js, forEach2.js <br>
  <strong> You </strong> would add your file inside the toyProblems folder as <strong>forEach3.js</strong>
