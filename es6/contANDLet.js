// const, let, and var
var name = 'Jane';
var title = 'Software Engineer';
var hourlyWage = 40;

// ES6
const name = 'Jane';
let title = 'Software Engineer';
let hourlyWage = 40;

// some time later ...
title = 'Senior Software Engineer';
hourlyWage = 45;

// title & hourlyWage can be changed (mutated) because they
// were declared as a "let" variable.

// we would get an error if we tried to change "name"
// because it was delcared as a "const" variable
